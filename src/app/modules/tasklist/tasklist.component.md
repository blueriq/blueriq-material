### Task list container
This component displays task lists. A Task List is a container of type `AQ_TaskList` that has been introduced in 
Blueriq 12.0.

### Reactive list
The Task List Container obtains task updates from a Server Sent Event stream, so the content of the list is updated
without the user having to reload the page.
